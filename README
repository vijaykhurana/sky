1) The application listens on port 8180

2) In real life applications, a healthcheck would be provided for each external dependency of our app.
Since the Sky Exercise Application has no such dependencies, there were no healthchecks added. A corresponding message for missing healthchecks appears when running or building the app.

3) jasmine-maven-plugin is used to run the jasmine test during build.
This uses HtmlUnit which does not play nicely with the latest versions of jQuery and logs some css validation and js errors during the build.
A workaround is to use jasmine-maven-plugin with phantomjs, but this would require installation of phantomjs in the system where the build runs.
As the errors do not affect the running of the jasmine tests, no further action was taken.
